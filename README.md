# esp32s2_core
ESP32-S2 core designed as a part of CircuitART kit which consist of 5 core boards and a Feather format carrier board which gives you maximum flexabilty and elemenate the need of buying many dev boards or shileds.

CircuitART ESP32-S2 core is an open source Development board with support for Adafruit CircuitPython, Arduino IDE, and developmemnt platforms.
CircuitART Feather kit is able to act as a single solution for all projects great and small.
